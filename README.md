EditDistance
============
This is a task i did: 

Nowadays, searching is more important than organizing. 
In an upcoming project, the ability to search through tags assigned to assets will be important. 
The search feature needs to be able to correlate similar terms, or terms with typos in them, to the intended asset. 
This will be done by utilizing a computer science concept known as "edit distance". 
Create a one-page ASP MVC site that:
  Has a space to enter a comma-separated list of tags
  Has a space to enter a search term
  Has a button
  Has a results area
When the button is clicked, the page should make an AJAX call to the controller to compute the edit distance between each tag and the search term. Once the request is completed, the results should be shown in the results area.
